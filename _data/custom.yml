about: "We faced same troubles like all other people appearing for competitive exams. Mock tests that are paid, 
articles at various places and often quite sketchy. So we thought why not have info at one place and have tests 
at the same place. Helps save a lot of time. Thats resulted in this site and we wish to have a positive impact 
with this among the student community. We hope we can achieve this in the long run."
